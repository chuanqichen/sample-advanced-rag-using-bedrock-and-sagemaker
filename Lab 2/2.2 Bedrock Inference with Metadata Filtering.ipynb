    "In the examples so far you knew the filters that you need to apply. Perhaps your application forces the user to pick a year or department name while asking questions. In those situations, the above approach would work.\n",
    "However, you may have a situation where there is no way for a user to specify filters. Thus, the application may, at run time, have to figure out the filters based on a question.\n",
    "For example, assume that your documents are stored in respective department folders such as HR, Finance, Legal, Science, Engineering, Customer Support, etc. \n",
    "Assume that your user asks an HR related question. There are two options for you.\n",
    "### Option 1: \n",
    "You create a vector embedding for HR related questions and search the vector space in the entire knowledgebase. This will give you some context and might even pick up some HR related content from customer support content.\n",
    "### Option 2: \n",
    "You ask an LLM to determine the topic to which the question most likely belongs to.Then you use the topic as a filter to query the knowledge base. This limits the search to fewer topics and hence reduces the noise from unrelated topics.\n",
    "While this mightb improve accuracy because of richer context with reduced noise, this would also introduce extra costs because of an extra call to LLM to determine the topic to which the questuon belongs to."
