    "Chunking data is essential. If you are adding large documents with hundreds of pages to your knowledge base then you need to split them up and return only the relevant sections to use as context for your inference. If you are returning too much context it will increase costs (models charge based on input token count) and latency. It may also harm output quality. Shorter chunks will provide a better match but may lack the context necessary to answer a question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bedrock Knowledge bases has a few different chunking strategies to choose from. They handle everything from splitting at semantic boundaries like paragraphs and hierarchical structures. However some document types can benefit from custom chunking. For example, any form of mark up can be used by a custom chunking approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also create your own custom chunking approach using a Lambda function. If you want to add any custom metadata then you will need to add a Lambda function. You can either handle the chunking yourself, edit an existing chunk or just add metadata. Metadata can then be used for filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to tune your chunking to the type of documents being ingested. Getting the wrong chunk size will affect the accuracy and response times. It will also increase the costs in both the vector storage and inference steps. The defaults supplied in Bedrock are pretty good but they may need tailored to your specific circumstances. Longer and more technical documents may need larger chunk sizes to make sure they include more context. Speech (like a chat transcript) can benefit from shorter chunks.\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will implement a knowledge base using a fixed chunking strategy. Here are the key steps we'll perform:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a Knowledge Base**: Set up an Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base with fixed-size chunking configuration that will store and retrieve our vector embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a Data Source**: Connect our Knowledge Base to the documents we uploaded to S3 in the previous notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Start Ingestion Job**: Begin the process of transforming our documents into chunks, creating embeddings, and storing them in our vector database.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Retrieve and Generate**: Test our Knowledge Base by retrieving relevant information based on a sample query."

    "#### Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fixed Chunking**: Involves dividing your documents into fixed-size chunks, regardless of the content within them. Each chunk contains a predefined number of tokens or characters, and this method allows for more uniform data organization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fixed chunking is useful when you want to ensure that your chunks are of a consistent size, making them easier to process and retrieve in a predictable manner. The document is split into sections of equal length, and each section becomes a separate chunk. This method works well when the content is relatively homogeneous, and the chunk boundaries are not as crucial to understanding the underlying context.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Uniformity**: Each chunk has the same size, making the system more predictable. This helps with processing efficiency since you know that each chunk is of a consistent size, making batch operations and parallel processing easier.\n",
    "- **Simplified Retrieval**: Since the chunk sizes are uniform, searching through the data becomes straightforward. You can quickly determine the length of chunks, which can be useful for performance optimization and scalability in large datasets.\n",
    "- **Performance Optimization**: Fixed chunks are ideal when you want to control the computational cost of document retrieval and chunking. Having equal-sized chunks reduces the chance of computational bottlenecks in scenarios requiring large-scale document processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** While fixed chunking can be efficient for certain use cases, it may not preserve the natural semantic boundaries of the content, such as paragraphs or sections. This may lead to chunks that start or end at arbitrary places, potentially cutting off context in the middle of a sentence or idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Best Use Cases**\n",
    "Fixed chunking is suitable for cases where:\n",
    "- **Homogeneous content**: The content is consistent, and boundaries are not as important.\n",
    "- **Performance**: You need uniform-sized chunks for predictable processing or optimization of large-scale systems.\n",
    "- **Simplified text processing**: When chunk boundaries do not need to match natural semantic structures like paragraphs or sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples include:\n",
    "- **General document indexing**: When large datasets are involved, and uniform chunk sizes optimize retrieval.\n",
    "- **Text summarization**: Fixed chunking is helpful when generating summaries from uniformly sized data pieces.\n"
