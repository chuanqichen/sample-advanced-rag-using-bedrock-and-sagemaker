    "## Query Decomposition: Avoid semantic delutions in the queries\n",
    " * \"Semantic dilutions\" refer to the loss of meaning or relevance when chunks of text, intended to represent information for retrieval, become too large or lack semantic cohesion, leading to less accurate and useful results.\n",
    " * Semantic dilutions can be mitigated on the indexed documents side by applying optimized chunking strategies per each use case.\n",
    " * Query texts can also have semantic delutions when multiple contexts or topics are combined. This can be improved by reforming the queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will demonstrate \"query decomposition\" strategy to improve the search quality against a knowledge base. \n",

    "### How Model Size Affects Table Interpretation  \n",
    "\n",
    "When querying Amazon’s Operating Income for 2022, **smaller models (Nova Lite, Llama 3B)** tend to pick the **\"At Prior Year Rates\"** value (\\$11,387), while **larger models (Nova Pro)** correctly select the **\"As Reported\"** value (\\$12,248).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Possible Reasons:\n",
    "- **Table Parsing Limitations:** Smaller models may not accurately align column headers to values.  \n",
    "- **Context Misinterpretation:** They might default to the last numerical column or fail to strongly associate **\"As Reported\"** with the correct column.  \n",
    "- **Stronger Reasoning in Larger Models:** Nova Pro better understands structured data, leading to more accurate retrieval.  \n",

For some ambiguous queries, we also directly generate helpful SQL responses, that consider multiple aspects of ambiguity, instead of requesting user clarification. To benchmark the performance on ambiguous, unanswerable, and answerable questions, we implemented large language model (LLM)-based baselines using various LLMs. Our approach involves two steps: question category classification and clarification SQL prediction. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art systems struggle to handle ambiguous and unanswerable questions effectively. We will release our code for data generation and experiments on GitHub1. \\n \\n 1 Introduction \\n \\n Text-to-SQL systems aim to convert natural lan- guage questions into SQL queries that can be used to query a database.

We then leverage an LLM to convert the data into conversations be- tween the user and a text-to-SQL assistant that in- cludes user initial questions, assistant clarification questions, user clarification responses, assistant SQL responses, SQL execution results, and natural language explanations of the execution results (as shown in Figure 1). In addition to having conver- sations where the assistant asks for clarification questions, we also generated more helpful SQL responses that included the results of all possible responses for some ambiguous question categories. To assess the quality of our generated dataset we define annotation criteria for two tasks, question category classification, and conversation quality evaluation, and conduct human annotation on the generated data to show that our dataset is of high quality.', 'PRACTIQ: A Practical Conversational text-to-SQL dataset with Ambiguous and Unanswerable Queries \\n \\n Mingwen Dong†∗ Nischal Ashok Kumar‡* \\n \\n Yiqun Hu†, Anuj Chauhan†, Chung-Wei Hang†, Shuaichen Chang†, Lin Pan†, Wuwei Lan†, Henghui Zhu†, Jiarong Jiang†, Patrick Ng†, Zhiguo Wang† \\n \\n ‡University of Massachusetts at Amherst, †Amazon Web Services nashokkumar@cs.umass.edu, {mingwd, jiarongj, zhiguow}@amazon.com \\n \\n Abstract \\n \\n Previous text-to-SQL datasets and systems have primarily focused on user questions with clear intentions that can be answered. How- ever, real user questions can often be ambigu- ous with multiple interpretations or unanswer- able due to a lack of relevant data. In this work, we construct a practical conversational text-to- SQL dataset called PRACTIQ, consisting of am- biguous and unanswerable questions inspired by real-world user questions. We first identi- fied four categories of ambiguous questions and four categories of unanswerable questions by studying existing text-to-SQL datasets.', 'We convert our data into conversational forms leveraging reverse generation (generating SQL first and then generating user clar- ification responses) using an LLM (see Figure 1). \\n \\n 2.2 Ambiguity and Unanswerability in text-to-SQL systems \\n \\n Recent research has identified the presence of am- biguous and unanswerable questions in practical text-to-SQL systems. However, they primarily fo- cused on creating ambiguous or unanswerable data to train question classifiers (Zhang et al., 2020) or covered only a limited range of ambiguous/u- nanswerable categories (Wang et al., 2023a). Con- currently, Bhaskar et al. (2023) introduced Am- biQT, a benchmark containing ambiguous text-to- SQL queries spanning four ambiguous categories, and suggested generating multiple SQL queries to encompass the correct SQL. More recently, AM- BROSIA defined and generated ambiguous text-to- SQL data based on scope ambiguity, attachment ambiguity, and vagueness but did not cover unan- swerable categories (Saparina and Lapata, 2024). Text2Analysis (He et al., 2024) focuses on struc- tured data and also includes unclear queries, how- ever, its queries focus more on advanced analysis skills rather than text-to-SQL. Our dataset differs in several key aspects.']\u001b[0m\n",
